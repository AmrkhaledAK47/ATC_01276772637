// TEST CASE 1: Email Registration and Verification Flow
// -----------------------------------------------------

/**
 * Steps:
 * 1. Open the application and navigate to the Auth page
 * 2. Select the "Register" tab
 * 3. Fill in registration details:
 *    - Full Name: "Test User"

 *    - Password: "SecurePassword123!"
 * 4. Check "I agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy"
 * 5. Click "Create account"
 * 6. Verify you are redirected to the OTP verification page
 * 7. In development mode, use DevOtpViewer to retrieve the OTP
 * 8. Enter the OTP and click "Verify Email"
 * 9. Verify you are redirected to the dashboard after successful verification
 * 10. Verify the user's isVerified status in the database is true
 *
 * Expected Results:
 * - Registration completes successfully
 * - OTP is generated and can be retrieved in dev mode
 * - User receives success message after verification
 * - User is redirected to the dashboard
 * - User's isVerified status is updated in the database
